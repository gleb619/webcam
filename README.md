# Goal
Main goal of app is watch for your home or what ever your want. You download client, setting it(folder for save and etc), log in and it works. client makes photo every 5 seconds(optional, you set it up frequency) and if current photo different from the last, client send this photo to the server. After all you can look what happened in your home or work.

------------

I did not finish the project, now it may not work without me, sorry for that.<br>
For start you must set up db for server(I use Postgres) and recompile client(for native url settings in debug mode).<br>
I needed to write player for server(now it only photo gallery, which is not very convenient).<br>
And a social network around it, not big deal, right)))<br>
